              <p>I am an Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering undergraduate from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. I am currently studying at my final year in my undergraduate career. I was also a student of Royal College Colombo, where I completed my G.C.E. advanced level studies in physical science stream in 2012. I had been a student of Royal College since 2004.
                  <h3>Early Life</h3>
                  I was born in De Zoysa Maternity Hospital in Colombo on a shiny day in October 1993. I was raised by my mom, dad, aunt and my grandma in a beautiful village not so close to the suburb Ruwanwella in Kegalle district. My childhood was spent with joy and laughter with a lot of fascinating fellow children of the neighbouring villagers. I moved to Veyangoda, where I currently live, in 1998 with my family and my school life started here. I have spent the first 5 and a half years of my primary school life in a school nearby, where I collected most of my childhood experiences and friends.
                  <br></br>
                  Growing up in Veyangoda, I was becoming a more focused and more attentive child who had only interests in studies and playing with friends. While I was carrying my educational life exceptionally, I used not to miss any of my evenings to play with the neighbourhood gang. It was an amazing time in my life. I continued that life until the mid of 2010 before when I started to put my whole focus for my advaced level studies in high school.
                  <br></br>
                  After successfully completing my examinations, I got selected to University of Moratuwa for my higher education in Engineering discipline. University gave me a whole new experience in life, which I was never exposed to before. I started working in Rotaract Club where I could collect an amazing set of experiences for my life. I worked with teams to compete in Hackathons, to win in robotics competitions and so many other activities, which I still love the most about my University life.
